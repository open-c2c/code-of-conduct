# Chat Code of Conduct
[Canadian Furries Coast to Coast (C2C)](https://github.com/open-c2c)

Open Furry Convention Project (OpenFurCon)

*Last revised: July 2020*

## Our Telegram Groups
We have two groups: SFW (Safe for Work) and NSFW (Not Safe for Work). There are base rules that apply to both of them, but each Telegram group may have an extra set of rules on top of the base rules.

These rules may be updated from time to time to better serve our community, we will inform the groups through a pinned message when this code of conduct changes.

## Mods and Admins
If you need assistance regarding participants breaking rules, or need help interpreting the rules, ask us by mentioning `@admin`.


## Base Rules

- Different views on a subject will happen, if so, keep it respectful. Avoid making personal attacks.
  - Some topics are forbidden, as we do not share those views, or outright forbidden by law, such as discriminatory statements of of any kind (whether based on race, sex, gender, sexuality, or national, religious, or ethnic background). This includes any statement or post that supports fascism, Nazism, "alt-furry," and hate discourse. For example, it is okay to talk about how bigotry is a problem, but it's not okay to post an image of your fursona giving a Nazi salute. It is also not okay to post crypto-fascist memes, meaning sayings or images designed to appear harmless while actually signaling support for bigotry and/or fascism.
- When promoting products or services (such as, but not limited to: current commission slots, immediate (same day or this week) live streams, or current items for sale), please limit it to once per day. For any given event, don't post more than three times, even across multiple days.
- Please ask an admin before posting a link to your/other groups on telegram. We’d like to prevent too much spam, we’d like to raise our members, and most importantly, we’d like to prevent someone from just posting a link to a hate group/a group that can cause issues. 
- Gifs and stickers are a core feature of Telegram, but use them in moderation. Do not create walls of gifs or stickers. For example: please don't post more than three gifs or stickers in a row by yourself.
- If a mod or an admin asks you to comply with something, please do. It’s okay to ask in private why if you don’t understand what happened.
- RP (role-play) is fun, but take it to a private chat if it gets drawn out. In general, if most posts on your screen are RP, it should be moved out of the chat. Exceptions can be made for common gestures, such as *hugs.*
- No bullying/harassment of any kind against anyone. Period.
- Anyone who is part of a furry ‘alt-right’ group/hate group etc (such as, but not limited to: Altfurry, Nazifurs, Furry Raiders, Order of the Golden Talon) and that have any indication in said group of transphobia, homophobia, sexism, bullying, harassment or other such hateful practices are not welcome, and will be immediately banned. 
- Please limit yourself to one selfie a day at most. Furry convention photos are an exception to this rule, though you should still avoid spamming the chat.
- Images and drawings of graphic violence or other disturbing images are not permitted.
- The point of the chat is furry and furry-related topics, not format wars. Please refrain from comments regarding ”Apple/Android rules/sucks” or any other debates about the merits of brands (game consoles, etc.). 
- If a situation is not covered in this code of conduct, the admin/mod interpretation will be considered final until this code of conduct is reviewed.

## SFW Chat Rules
- **All of the previously mentioned Base Rules.**
- Absolutely no suggestive, NSFW, or explicit gifs, stickers, images, or statements. The SFW chat should be acceptable for all ages. When in doubt, ask an admin.
- If you have a NSFW display image on Telegram, consider participating only on the NSFW chat instead.
- NSFW display images can include but not limited to: nudity, sex toys, sexual acts, or sexually suggestive content. 
- Keep conversation PG; there is no age restriction to be part of this group. Young furries will be present. 
- Try not to spam, if possible. Pack your photos in one album and generally limit yourself to three messages in a row.
NSFW Chat Rules
- All of the previously mentioned Base Rules.
- Users must be 18 years or older. No exceptions.
- While this is a furry chat, real life photos are also OK, especially if it’s from you, but should be furry themed. 
- People on those photos including you must be over 18 and be consensual.
- Make sure you have permission to share those images or photos. 
- Murrsuit content is allowed under the same criteria.
- No body shaming for RL photos. If you don’t like it, carry on.
- Try not to spam, if possible. Pack your photos in one album and generally limit yourself to three messages in a row.
- Bestiality and underage sexual content are not allowed, not to mention a crime under Canadian law. Do not post images or links to this material. Stories and images must pass the Harkness Test: are all characters of sexual maturity for their species and able to give consent? If so, you can post it.
- We embrace all kinks and fetishes, but (for the sake of keeping the chat of general interest) the following imagery is not allowed: Scat, hard vore (soft vore is okay), gore, watersports, blood, dismemberment, death, cub porn, non-consensual, suffocation, ball crush, or any images of minors/images that appear to be of minors. Use common sense for related material that might fall into this category (such as non-fetish blood, death, gore etc). 
  - It’s NOT OK to link this material if illegal. (Illegal content can include, but is not limited to: non-consensual, minors, bestiality, etc).
  - If not illegal, it’s OK to link this material provided you give a fair warning about the content before people follow the link. For example, if a drawing posted in the chat is allowed in the chat, but the artist draws a lot of content that would violate this rule, please warn users about what to expect if you link to their gallery.
- Be considerate. Do not make remarks about having too much straight content or too much gay content. Do not spam content of your fetish (plenty of specialized groups exist) and don't complain if a kink you aren't into is occasionally posted. Carry on. 

## Penalties
It’s expected that rules will be broken due to lack of understanding and retention of details; admins and mods will try their best to put you on the right track.

Admins and mods can enforce an action against you based on their interpretation of your actions. Those actions against you can include either a temporary or permanent removal from the groups.

If you feel that your expelling wasn’t fair, you can reach out to other mods or admins and ask for a review. We will all review the facts and give a deliberation about your case. This deliberation is final.

Be advised that, because this chat is associated with several Canadian furry cons, severe violations of the rules may result in you being banned from other groups or real-life furry events. It's reasonable to expect that staff members from conventions will see what you post in our chats. If you are banned from a group or event, you will have to appeal to its organizers, not to C2C. Your actions online can have consequences offline. 

## Addendum
This document was written for the Open Code of Conduct Project, a collaborative pro bono effort by Canadian Furries Coast-to-Coast. The project's purpose is to ensure that furry conventions do not have to put forth redundant effort creating codes of conduct independently. 

Canadian Furries Coast-to-Coast (known as "C2C") is an association of furry conventions across Canada. C2C's mission is to support furry conventions worldwide and ensure they are safe, supportive, and sustainable events.

This document may be freely used (in whole or in part, modified or unmodified) by any other convention, meet-up, or similar gathering, in Canada or internationally. It does not constitute professional legal or medical advice.

The above does not restrict the authority of the convention to remove or add any necessary policy or procedure at any time without any prior warning. Any modifications to these policies or procedures will be accompanied by immediate notification via social media and the convention website whenever practical.
