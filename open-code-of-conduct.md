## Introduction
The following is the summary of the rules and regulations for this convention. For more details, please consult Convention Operations.

Our primary goal is for everyone to have fun at the convention. To that end, we need to enforce some basic rules. These rules not only keep the environment welcoming for everyone and a positive view for outsiders, but also ensure the convention can return to the venue in the future.

 ## Badges and Convention Identification
 You will need to present a school- or government-issued photo ID to claim your badge. Examples include: drivers license, passport, tribal ID/status card, or college ID. If you've had a name change since getting your ID, bring proof of that change.

Please always remember to have your badge visible when you are in the convention space. This is your identification when entering events within the space. You won't be permitted in most convention spaces without it.

Badges for adults will be visibly different from those for minors (usually via a different background color). Please do not cover up parts of the badge (with stickers, ribbons, et cetera) that show this difference. 

The convention badge provided to you at Registration is property of the convention and must be surrendered upon request (for example, if you are removed from the convention for a rules violation). By default, you may keep your badge after the end of the convention. The convention may ban some combinations of characters (such as profanity) from badges and/or registration info in the interest of a welcoming environment.

By accepting your badge, you are agreeing to abide by all the convention policies as well as any other agreements that may be necessary. If you misplace your badge, please contact Convention Operations.

## Convention Rating
The convention is considered rated at PG-13 in all public areas. (Material, speech, and conduct that would not be suitable viewing for children 12 years of age or younger is not permitted in any public area.) Attendees are required to respect the "safe for work" rating of these spaces. 

An example of conduct unsuitable for public convention spaces would be displaying pornographic or realistic violent imagery/audio in a manner that is visible/audible from a distance (for how this applies to the sale of goods, see Dealers and Artists).

Some private areas may be rated 18+ and will be accessible only to persons over the age of 18. These will have controlled access and may require the display of photo identification along with convention badges to verify age before admittance. These areas may include: 1) some discussion panels (noted in schedule), 2) sections of the Art Show, and 3) sections of the Dealers Den and/or Artist Alley. 

The code of conduct applies to all areas regardless of rating status. Harassing others or being disruptive in a mature area may result in an attendee's membership being revoked, just as it would in another space.

Areas designated 18+ are off-limits to minors regardless of parental consent or accompaniment. Exceptions may be made for infants (under two years of age) carried by their legal guardians, depending on the situation and whether this causes a disruption. 

Children 12 and under are required to be escorted by an adult at all times in the convention space. The convention may make some panels, events, or areas age-restricted to minors and their legal guardians. Such spaces may include a "Young Furry Hang-Out Zone" or similar, which will be listed as such in the schedule and at the door. Convention staffers will be present at the door, checking badges. 

Failing to escort children 12 and under may result in loss of membership. Neither convention staffers nor volunteers are responsible for escorting children. Unescorted children should be reported to Convention Security as soon as possible.

## General Behavior
Attendees are required to exercise good judgement. 

Convention spaces are open ONLY to registered attendees or visitors being escorted by staff.

Badges are issued only to one person and may not be shared at any time or for any reason.

Attendees may not display 18+ items in PG-13 areas. For example: carrying a sexually-explicit comic is acceptable (so long as the cover is not explicit), but reading that comic in view of others is not.

Public displays of affection are allowed in convention spaces, so long as the activity is PG-13 and does not obstruct the flow of traffic. No sleeping in any public areas of the hotel or in convention spaces. 

Food and drink may be prohibited in some areas (such as the Art Show). These areas will be marked.

Smoking and vaping is prohibited on the property except in designated smoking and vaping areas. Hotel property rules prohibit the use of substances other than tobacco, such as cannabis or its derivatives. Drinking alcohol is permitted in hotel rooms and the hotel restaurant/bar, but prohibited in all convention spaces and hotel common areas (hallways, elevators, lobby, and so on). Sale, distribution, or the unlawful use/possession of controlled substances will not be tolerated at the convention. Anyone violating applicable laws may be immediately ejected from the convention, their membership revoked, and law enforcement contacted.

Pets are not permitted in the convention space. For information on service animals, see Accessibility.

Any act of vandalism or deliberate damage to the hotel or hotel property will result in immediate revocation of convention membership. Such damage may also result in legal action.

Merchandise sales may only be performed in the Dealers Den, Artist Alley, or any area similarly designated by convention staff and only by parties who have prior arrangements with the convention or hotel to conduct business. Please do not "camp out" in a common area selling merch. The convention also prohibits attempts to sell services or recruit people into organizations outside of the approved spaces.  Buying or selling merchandise outside of the designated areas may result in revocation of attendance and possible banning. (This policy isn’t in place to punish artists for trying to casually sell sketchbook commissions. The convention is legally required to regulate sales for the purposes of collecting sales tax, preventing sales of illegal substances, et cetera.)

Attendees are required to follow any reasonable instructions given by a staff member. If an attendee believes an instruction is not reasonable, they should address that concern with the manager of that department. Disputes are escalated as necessary, but the decision of the directors/convention chair is final.

Lasers and other powerful light-emitting devices that have the potential to damage the eyes are not allowed in convention spaces without prior authorization from Convention Operations. Class 1 lasers are generally allowed, but higher classes are not. Strobe lights and other powerful flashing devices should avoid the 2 Hz to 55 Hz cycle range to avoid inducing epileptic seizures.

## Cameras and Recordings
Personal cameras are welcome in the convention space. However, attendees are required to ask permission before taking video/photographs that could identify a specific person. For example: a crowd shot from a distance is permitted, but taking a photograph of someone's face without asking is not permitted (see Privacy). 

If you are a member of the press or academia here to record the event, and you wish to bring large cameras and other devices, you must obtain a press badge (see Journalists).

Cameras are prohibited in the Art Show and may be prohibited in other areas as posted.

Recordings that are both 1) made in the interest of public safety and 2) presented to convention staff are exempt from privacy restrictions. Examples include: someone making verbal threats (see Harassment/Assault), someone damaging hotel property (see Hotels and Room Parties), or someone dressed in hate symbols (see Bigotry). This exemption exists because the convention needs to identify the person or persons in question. Such recordings should be presented to convention staff as soon as possible and will need a copy to be transmitted (via email, text message, memory card, et cetera).

Most camera drones are allowed outside the convention building, but not inside it without permission in advance from Convention Operations. For very large drones that require certification in the convention's area, please bring that paperwork to Convention Operations. Very small drones (or similar flying devices) do not require permission, assuming the following conditions are met: 1) the overall device is smaller than 15 centimeters across (when in flight mode and not counting any helium bladders) and weighs less than 150 grams, 2) the propeller blades are smaller than 5cm, have a guard covering their edges, and do not turn with more force than can be safely stopped with a finger at full speed, 3) the battery is type 1s (meaning a single cell), and 4) the device is used in a way that is not dangerous or disruptive. The convention is not responsible for damage or loss of drones, nor for damage caused by drones.

## Hotels and Room Parties
The person named in the room reservation is responsible for anyone staying in the room and any damage that occurs.

The convention and the hotel may put limits on the number of rooms a person or organization is allowed to book. This policy is to allow all guests fair access to hotel rooms. Anyone caught interfering with the reservation of rooms (such as by booking large numbers of rooms to deny them to others) may be banned from both the convention and the hotel chain (such hotel bans are often for life).

No signs, stickers, tape, pins, or other such materials may be posted on hotel walls, floors, ceilings, hallways, or elevators of the hotel. There will be an area for any convention-related postings. Depending on the hotel, attendees may or may not be allowed to put items on hotel room doors, so please inquire with hotel staff to see if room party signs are allowed.

Room parties are allowed, but noise must be kept to a level to not disturb other attendees, especially during night hours (10 PM - 10 AM). Doors to hotel rooms must be kept shut. Parties should not spill out into the hallways, even if the partygoers have booked multiple nearby rooms. If you intend to have a large room party, we recommend booking a suite of two connected rooms. Remember: sound carries much further in hallways than in a room with a closed door.

Noise complaints will receive a single warning from the hotel staff, after which point they may be ejected from the hotel. Attendees will be expected to obey the same rules as other guests of the hotel. The convention is not responsible if you are ejected from the hotel and your registration fees will not be refunded in such a case.

The attendee hosting the room party is responsible for cleanup. Housekeeping will ONLY clean up bagged trash. When checking out, ensure that all trash is bagged to avoid additional cleaning fees from the hotel.

Be advised that various hotels around the convention likely have agreements with the convention, such as offering rooms at a lower rate. These hotels expect convention attendees to follow these rules, even if they are not associated with the convention center itself.

## Lost and Found
Lost and found will be maintained in the Convention Operations office. If you lose an item, check here first. A report can be filled out describing the item and contact information must be left. If possible, provide a photograph of the missing item. The convention is not responsible for lost or stolen items. Items in the lost and found will be kept for at least 48 hours after the con ends. Item photos may be posted on the convention's social media. The convention may require proof of ownership (such as a photograph with the item) in some cases. The convention is not obligated to pay shipping costs to return items.

## Dress Code
The convention is for everyone’s enjoyment. We recognize that part of the fun is to dress up as something wonderful and fantastic, and so we provide the following rules for keeping our environment safe, friendly, and fun.

The convention is considered rated at PG-13 in all public areas. Material, speech, and conduct that would not be suitable viewing for children 12 years of age or younger is not permitted in any public area. Your attire and appearance in public areas must be suitable for a PG-13 audience. 

The convention will have designated staff members who are qualified to review an attendee’s dress code for appropriateness. Attendees of good faith, who are judged to have an inappropriate dress code, will be given the opportunity to change their dress to something appropriate. Repeated violations of the dress code may result in removal from the convention and/or permanent ban. 

Some clothing may be deemed impermissible. This includes: symbols of hate speech (see Bigotry); clothing that may be confused with uniformed services (see below); and clothing that may be confused for a role of authority (looks too much like hotel staff, looks too much like Convention Security, et cetera).

Cosplay is not consent. Please ask before touching fursuiters and cosplayers. Touching them without permission will be treated the same as touching any other attendee. Please keep in mind that fursuiters often have limited visibility because of their head-pieces and may not notice someone in their personal space; this can result in them tripping over or colliding with others who do not ask for permission to get close.

Collars and leashes may be worn, but persons cannot be led around by them in public areas in ways that create a disruption in traffic or present a tripping hazard. Pup-play masks, bondage cuffs, and similar items may be worn, but interactions should be of a non-sexual manner and all other clothing rules must be followed. 

Do not wear costumes or other elements in public areas that would not be suitable for public view. Do not wear a costume that includes elements that would be considered unsuitable for view; remove such elements from your costume before entering public areas. Any openings in a fursuit that might expose the wearer's nipples, buttocks, or genitals must have a garment covering them. Costumes that might expose such areas on the wearer in the course of being worn are likewise not allowed. 

Materials that are too thin to conceal the genitals, buttocks, or nipples do not count as covering those areas. Likewise, a diaper does not count as coverage. Paint is not considered clothing.

Fursuits are not permitted in pools or hot tubs.

Attendees are responsible for ensuring their costumes are safe to wear. Costumes must present no danger to others (for example: no sharp spikes on armor). They should also not block traffic through the convention spaces or knock down items. As a general rule, verify that your costume can fit through regular doors before attempting to navigate a crowd in it.

The convention makes spaces available to drink water and cool off (the "headless lounge"), but staff cannot monitor all attendees. It is recommended to go out in costume with a friend who is out of costume, so they can prevent you from overheating or wandering into traffic. 

Some areas may be designated as only for ages 18+, such as an adults-only panel or an adults-only part of the Dealers Den. Such an area cannot be in plain view of other areas that are not designated 18+ (visibility will be blocked by doors, curtains, et cetera.) Materials, clothing, and apparel may be presented in an 18+ area that would not be appropriate for PG-13 areas. Do not leave an 18+ area to enter the public spaces without first properly concealing, stowing, and removing all materials that are inappropriate for a PG-13 audience.

Military, law enforcement, and other tactical-style gear in general is not suitable for a PG-13 environment. Do not attend the convention in "full camo" or a police/military uniform, as this easily crosses over into creating an intimidating atmosphere and confusion in emergencies. Dressing up as a SPECIFIC and FICTIONAL pop-culture character (such as Judy Hopps in her signature police uniform or Donald Duck in his iconic sailor suit) is permitted, so long as it conforms to all other rules. Uniforms from entirely fictional organizations (such as those in Star Trek or Star Fox) are acceptable, but again must conform to all other rules (including the rule against realistic weapons). Fursuits may be granted a limited exception: they may include some aspects of a police/military uniform. However, this is judged on a case-by-case basis by designated convention staff, with the main criteria being whether attendees would find the costume threatening. For example: dressing as a canine cosmonaut is not an implied threat of violence, but dressing as a Nazi is an implied threat of violence no matter how much fake fur is piled on. Costumes with police or military elements that are not a specific and fictional character must be cleared with convention staff before being worn. Incidental elements are permitted at the convention's discretion. For example, a vintage military jacket with obvious punk rock patches may be acceptable, but full-body camo would not be, even if sold as outdoor sporting gear. The determining factor is whether the garments could be seen as threatening or be confused with actual members of real-life organizations.

If you have a costume or fursuit and you would like to verify if it is allowed, please show a PHOTOGRAPH to convention staff BEFORE entering the convention with the item. 

## Bigotry
The convention is for everybody’s enjoyment. Attendees should be mindful of others' rights and differing backgrounds. For example, avoid using "coon" to refer to a raccoon in contexts where casual observers may interpret it as a racial slur. 

The convention has a zero-tolerance policy toward intolerance. Hate speech and hate symbols are inappropriate for our convention, as allowing them would encourage further encroachments on the rights of others. While other first-time infractions may only result in a warning, displays of hate (such as the following) that target protected groups will result in an immediate ban.

Human rights are not up for debate at the convention. The convention will not make allowances for "differences of opinion" in matters related to human rights (including racial and gender equality). Speech or displays that call into question human rights, as defined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, will result in an immediate ban from the convention. An attendee's right to freedom of expression stops where the rights of others begin.


Attendees who are concerned about someone's dress or behavior, or if are unsure about their own dress or behavior, should speak to convention staff. Convention staff will be found in designated areas at the convention, such as Convention Operations and Registration. Our staff is eager to work in good faith to ensure that everyone has a good time. 

The convention will not tolerate bigotry. Racist, sexist, and other bigoted behavior may result in an immediate ban from the convention and/or criminal charges, even if it is the first offense. We encourage all attendees to report such behavior to Convention Security and record the event if possible, so that the convention will know immediately what happened. 

The following rules give a basic outline of what the convention will consider bigotry. No exceptions will be made for the sake of free speech or satire/parody/irony.

Do not use slurs if you are not of the background the slur targets. If you are of that background, you will still be expected to maintain the overall PG-13 environment of the convention. Even in sanctioned contexts (such as an 18+ panel about bigoted depictions in old cartoons), all attendees will be expected to speak in a respectful manner.

Attendees of all backgrounds are allowed to cosplay as any character. However, racist/sexist/bigoted depictions are not allowed. Do not dress as someone from a historically or presently exploited group if you are not of that background. Do not wear a feather headdress if you are not First Nations. Blackface and similar techniques are not allowed. Attendees at the convention are reminded that this is a furry convention and that a vast array of non-human characters are available to them for cosplay purposes, so making others uncomfortable with bigoted depections is easy to avoid.

Hate symbols are banned. This includes hate symbols modified in some way (such as adding a paw print). The convention follows guidelines provided by organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Canadian Anti-Hate Network in identifying hate symbols. This includes, but is not limited to: arm/head/tail bands, shirts, pants, fursuits, costumes, flags, props, jewelry, exposed tattoos, stickers, or any other display at staff discretion. Examples include: Trump/MAGA hats, Daesh/ISIL flags, KKK hoods, crosses on fire, nooses, swastikas, the stylized SS of the Schutzstaffel, Confederate flags, iron crosses, "blue lives matter" flags, and so on, as well as images/names/costumes/depictions of persons (real or fictional) associated with those symbols.


Displays of hate are prohibited, even if they do not include visible props. Playing certain audio (such as music from Nazi marches), making certain statements (such as racial slurs or fascist/cryptofascist references like "white power" or "white genocide"), writing/drawing certain text/images (such as "1488" or racist caracatures), or performing certain gestures (such as the "Nazi salute") counts as display of a hate symbol. Displays of hate are still hate symbols even if animal imagery is substituted for human imagery. A Nazi armband is still a Nazi armband, even if it has a paw print in place of a swastika. Exceptions will not be made to accommodate supposed satire or irony, as any sufficiently advanced parody is indistinguishable from the real thing.

Art or speech in opposition to bigotry is allowed, but it must be obvious to the convention staff and other attendees, even from a distance. For example: art can depict a werewolf ripping apart a Nazi flag, but it must be clear from a distance that the image is not simply of a Nazi flag. A badge ribbon saying "Nazi furs fuck off" is allowed, but a similar ribbon saying "anti-fascist furries fuck off" would be in support of fascists and therefore is banned. Likewise, a sticker saying "Black lives matter" is acceptable, but "parody" or oppositional variants such as "black Labradors matter" or "all lives matter" or "blue lives matter" are banned.

Membership in groups, including furry-specific groups, that target protected classes is also grounds for being banned. Membership in forums or chat groups dedicated to "alt-furry" or similar fascist/cryptofascist groups can result in a preemptive ban. Anyone banned in such a manner who still appears at the convention will be notified to leave. Failure to leave may result in a trespassing charge or other legal action. The convention is a private event held on private property and is well within its rights to determine who may and may not attend, especially when ensuring the safety of attendees and respect for their rights.

Persons who have previously been banned for involvement in hate groups or activity may, after extensive and demonstrable anti-bigotry behavior (such as volunteering for charities that support the sort of equality the person previously opposed), contact the convention via email to ask for a ban to be lifted. The convention is under no obligation to lift such bans. 

## Harassment/Assault
All reports of harassment/assault are taken very seriously. If you witness or are the victim of harassment or assault, report it to Convention Operations or Convention Security immediately. If you are in immediate danger, it can be reported to hotel security as well, but please also inform the Convention Security so they are aware of the situation.

It is not the job of the convention to solve your interpersonal problems. The convention is not able to prevent attendance of person(s) upon request unless they pose a specific, credible threat or have a criminal history of conviction of crimes which may pose a threat to the convention or its attendees. 

If an individual stalks, harasses, or attempts to assault you at the convention, report it to any member of the Convention Security staff. All matters reported are dealt with seriously and may become a criminal matter depending on the severity of the report.

Responsibility for settling personal disputes lies solely with the parties involved and any relevant authorities. Acts of violence are prohibited at the convention, even if neither party presses charges, and may result in revocation of membership or a ban.

## Privacy
Convention attendees agree to respect the privacy of their fellow conventioneers. While personal photography is permitted, regular attendees should refrain from recording extensive footage to repurpose later (see Journalists). Attendees are required to obtain permission from anyone who could be identified in the media they record (audio, video, photographs, et cetera). For example, recording a crowd from a distance is acceptable, but recording a clear image of someone's face without permission is not acceptable. In general, asking something like "Is it okay to take your picture?" meets this requirement.

Attendees should not ask convention staff, volunteers, or security for personal information about other attendees, as the convention cannot share that information in most cases (exceptions include: parents of underage attendees, missing persons, et cetera). Private information can include, but is not limited to: legal name, phone number, address, hotel room number, and presence or absence at the convention. The convention will make a good-faith effort to keep such information private. The convention may turn over information in the case of attendees under the age of 18 whose legal guardians can verify their identity. 

Devices designed to collect data from personal electronic devices without the users' permission are not permitted. 

The convention may share personal information in response to a related warrant, medical emergency, potential crime, missing person, et cetera. Anonymized attendance data (such as the number of attendees) may be provided to the International Anthropomorphic Research Project, the research arm of Furscience. The IARP/Furscience is a group of scholars and academics who study furries and the furry fandom to increase their understanding and decreasing stigma for other academics, furries, the media, and the general public. They frequently set up information booths to showcase their research and conduct surveys at conventions. Attendee participation in surveys is always voluntary.

## Weapons, Facsimiles, and Props
Weapons of any kind are NOT permitted in convention spaces, regardless of any permits for concealed/open carry of such items. This includes, but is not limited to: firearms, tasers/stun guns, pepper spray, explosives, dangerous chemicals, swords, knives, and so on. Swiss army knives, multi-tools with blades, and similar utility implements are allowed, so long as they can't be reasonably mistaken for weapons from a distance.

Magnetometer wands and other checks may be performed randomly by Convention Security to ensure compliance with this policy. Any violation will result in law enforcement being contacted and badges revoked for the duration of the convention.

Reasonable facsimiles of firearms are also prohibited in convention spaces. Prop weapons are allowed, but they must be obvious as props from a distance (an orange cap on the end of the barrel may not be enough). They must also have no mechanism to fire projectiles. Toys, such as water guns, may be allowed under this policy, but must be empty (to prevent damage to art and electronics). Prop bladed weapons must be made of plastic, foam, or other materials that cannot be visibly confused with real metal. Items used to commit violence will be considered weapons, regardless of other guidelines. 

As per the rules of dress code, attendees should consider if they can move freely and safely through doors and other public spaces while also carrying props. If such props present a hazard to safety, the attendee will be asked to surrender them to convention staff or to take them out of the public spaces. 

If attendees have a prop weapon and would like to verify if it is allowed, they should show a PHOTOGRAPH to convention staff BEFORE entering the convention with the item. 

## Substance Abuse
Attendees are required to be responsible while at the convention. This means obeying any laws concerning the use of substances and not being intoxicated in convention or hotel spaces. 

Please keep in mind that the convention space and the hotel may have their own restrictions, and such restrictions override the convention’s own policy. For example, the hotel may have a bar or restaurant that serves alcohol, but exciting such an area into convention spaces while intoxicated is not permitted.

Sale, distribution, use or possession of controlled substances will not be tolerated at the convention. Anyone violating applicable laws will be immediately ejected from the convention, membership revoked, and law enforcement contacted.

Regardless of local laws concerning marijuana, the convention has banned the use of cannabis and its derivatives on hotel and convention center grounds. In cases where the convention center or hotel has a more strict policy, we default to it.

If an attendee sees someone they believe may be experiencing a drug overdose, they should contact emergency medical services and inform Convention Operations immediately.

## Public Health
Attendees are required to maintain a basic level of hygiene. This includes (but is not limited to) having noticeable body odor from not showering, as well as wearing garments that are visibly soiled. Fursuits, props, and costumes must likewise meet these guidelines. Failure to meet these guidelines will result in the attendee being escorted out of the convention space and told to clean up. Returning without cleaning up will result in a revocation of membership.

The convention or other authorized organizations may distribute condoms or other sexual health items. The convention may also authorize organizations to offer sexually-transmitted disease tests. The presence of these items and services is within the bounds of a PG-13 setting.

For the safety of all involved, convention staff should not be expected to provide or administer medicines or other treatments, even those available without a prescription. 

In the case of a contagious disease outbreak, the convention may put additional rules (such as the following) into effect. These rules will be announced on social media and other platforms. Attendees can also check with convention staff about which rules are in place. Failure to comply with these rules may result in revocation of membership.

The convention may require social distancing. This could be through the use of markers on the floor, limits on how many people can be in a given room at a time, or other methods. 

The convention may require the use of face masks designed to prevent the spread of disease. If so, the following rules would apply. Any such mask must be of effective construction (whether handmade or store-bought). It must be worn to cover the nose and mouth. It must be worn at all times when attendees leave their hotel room. This includes hallways, elevators, lobbies, convention spaces, and outdoor areas on hotel/convention center grounds. Failure to comply with this rule can result in revocation of membership. Fursuit heads do not count as disease-prevention masks unless specifically modified to perform that function.

The convention may also opt to use a touch-free thermometer to determine if attendees are running a fever. This may be used to control access to some or all convention spaces. The convention may also use wristbands or similar markers to pre-clear attendees for re-entering convention spaces. The convention is not obligated to refund registration fees for anyone unable to attend because of illness.

## Accessibility
Attendees who may have trouble accessing parts of the convention space due to disability are encouraged to contact the convention ahead of time. The convention will make good-faith efforts to meet such needs, within the limits of what is allowed by the hotel/convention center. 

In some situations, the convention may opt to allow persons with a disability into a space early, save a space for them by removing or reserving chairs from a panel room, or take similar action. Attendees who would like this sort of help should contact Convention Operations.

For the safety of all involved, the convention may not be able to devote staff to assist in moving attendees between wheelchairs and vehicles (or similar situations). 

All attendees are required to leave paths between convention areas clear enough for persons with limited mobility to navigate (such as those with wheelchairs or crutches). Do not assume that other attendees can step over you. 

In accordance with local and national law, recognized service animals are permitted. Service animals should have vests or other gear marking them as such. Attempting to falsely claim an animal as a service animal may result in revocation of membership and local law enforcement involvement. Fursuits are allowed to wear service animal vests. Attendees should ask for permission before touching or feeding someone's service animal—service animals are doing an important job in an unfamiliar and busy space.

Attendees with respiratory problems are advised that the convention space may have perfumes, animal dander, or other airborne substances that could cause an allergic reaction or other breathing issue. 

## Dealers and Artists
Dealers and artists (collectively called "vendors" hereafter) are expected to follow the same rules as attendees and can likewise be banned (either as individuals or a company). 

Vendors will be allowed to set up in vendor spaces for some time before they open to the public. Likewise, vendors will be allowed to stay in vendor spaces for some time after they close to the public. The convention does require vendors to leave them after a certain time each night and may lock these spaces after that point.

Vendors are allowed to ask attendees lingering in front of their tables to move aside so traffic can continue. Attendees should not block access to tables if they are not actively shopping at them.

Attendees who damage items for sale may have their membership revoked.

Vendors found to be selling art without the artist's permission may be banned from the convention. For example: do not sell shirts with an image another artist created without permission, even if the image is modified. 

Because the Artist Alley and Dealers Den are not 18+ areas, special precautions must be taken when vendors sell items with adult elements. Adult elements include: exposed genitals and sexual fluids, as well as especially disturbing violence. Vendors may sell such items, but they must not have those elements in plain view. For example, an artist can sell erotic prints, so long as genitalia is covered with stickers or sticky notes. Books that contain adult imagery may simply be labeled as "NSFW" or "18+" on the cover, rather than on the internal art. Written profanity or textual depictions of adult activity may be granted more leeway if they cannot be read from a distance. In general, vendors are encouraged to place adult merch in a designated area of their table or label their items, so as to avoid confusion. Vendors are not allowed to sell adult merch to underage attendees and should verify that such buyers possess an "adult" convention badge. Vendors are also allowed to ask to see a photo ID when selling 18+ merch (even if the buyer has an adult badge).

The convention may opt to make an area into a secondary 18+ Dealers Den or Artist Alley, but such a space will be marked and have a staff member checking badges. This is the only context in which sex toys, sexually-explicit figurines, and similar items can be sold. 

Vendors are allowed to play audio or video at their booth, but it must not disrupt others or contain elements that violate other rules (such as explicit sexual content).

Vendors may sell food and beverages, but it must be in a sealed container. For example: a vendor can sell a can of soda, a bag of candy, or a jar of honey, but cannot sell sandwiches, unwrapped candy, or cups of soda. Anyone violating this rule will get a verbal warning before any other action is taken. Vendors cannot sell: 1) alcohol, tobacco, or drugs/medicines, 2) weapons or items which could be easily mistaken for weapons (see Weapons, Facsimiles, and Props), or 3) items specifically prohibited by the convention space or hotel or that would violate some other rule (such as items that feature hate symbols). The venue may also have food vendors who have an exclusive contract for selling food and drink.

The convention may host an Art Show and facilitate bidding on pieces. The convention reserves the right to curate what items are suitable for the show. Items are placed on display at the artist's risk. The convention is not responsible for damage or theft.

Depending on the year and the venue, the convention may have a first-come/first-served or lottery system for allocating vendor spaces. The convention may reserve a number of spaces for "anchor dealers." This is to ensure major dealers (such as publishers) who represent a large number of creators are assured a space. Priority may also be given to specifically-furry dealers. For example: a dealer selling animal-themed hats may get priority over a dealer selling hats of more general interest.

## Staff
The convention will allow some attendees to attend as volunteer staff in various capacities. These will include some combination of Convention Operations, Convention Security, and other departments, both at the convention and before it. Staff are expected to behave in a manner that represents the convention well. They are required to obey the same rules as regular attendees, except where their duties require otherwise with authorization from convention leadership. The convention is not required to make any particular person a staff member. By applying to be a staff member, you are agreeing to allow the convention to verify you are the right candidate for the position. This may include viewing your publicly-available activity online (social media, forums, chatrooms, art sites, et cetera) and conversations with others who have worked with you previously.

Staff members are required to wear their staff badge when on duty. They may also be required to wear a staff uniform while on duty, most often a t-shirt or vest.

Staff members will have their registration fees waived. They may, as time and budget allow, also be offered room and board, transportation, and other benefits. These benefits may be revoked in cases of serious rules violations or other misbehavior.

Staff members should expect to be held to higher standards than attendees, even for activity that does not occur at the convention itself or occurred online. Criminal activity, deceptive business practices, bigotry, membership in hate groups, violence, and harassment are all grounds for being removed from the convention staff. 

The convention may have some staff designated as Convention Security. The convention may also make agreements with organizations such as the Dorsai Irregulars (specialists in providing security at sci-fi and furry conventions) to provide security instead of organizing security on its own. The convention will make a good faith attempt to utilize organizations such as the Dorsai Irregulars prior to the hiring of any conventional private security company. Regardless of how security staff are related to the convention, Convention Security may not wear a police/military uniform or any clothing that could be confused for a police/military uniform from a distance. Convention Security should dress for easy visibility and may not wear camouflage-patterned shirts/pants/shorts/hats. Convention Security will instead wear a shirt or vest with the word "SECURITY" in large letters on it, clearly visible from a distance. 

## Journalists
Recognizing the public interest in our community, our convention welcomes journalists to attend and to record our event. 

Journalists will have their own badges available from Registration or Convention Operations. These will clearly identify the wearer with the word "press" and their organization. This may or may not be the same item as a registration badge. This increases visibility and credibility (other attendees are often more willing to talk to someone who has been vetted by the convention).

The convention recommends contacting staff before the convention starts, so that the convention can assign a staffer to act as a press attaché. This has several advantages. Staff are well-versed in the furry fandom and can provide cultural context. They can also ensure access to convention/hotel spaces (say, for better photography angles), bring in a wider range of interviewees (such as the guest of honor), and provide existing footage/photos/records. The convention may ask to see press credentials, in advance and/or upon arrival.

Persons attending the convention who represent themselves as journalists without wearing a press badge may have their attendance privileges revoked. 

Journalists are bound by the same rules as other attendees (photography is not permitted in Art Show areas, convention badge must be displayed, et cetera).

Interview areas can be set up by convention staff for journalists with press badges upon request.

Attendees with press badges may be given allowances to record the event. Journalists MUST identify themselves and their sponsoring organization to all interviewees, and they must get verbal permission from all interviewees to include their likenesses and their interviews. Recordings that cannot be used to identify specific individuals (such as crowd photos from a distance) are exempt from a requirement to obtain permission.

All journalists will be required to disclose the identity of their sponsoring organization before being issued a press badge/pass. Some organizations are prohibited outright, due to established patterns of endangering the human lives and human rights of those they record, especially women, minorities, and LGBT persons. Prohibited organizations include: News Corporation (Fox News Channel), Rebel News Network, Ltd. (Rebel Media), The Daily Caller, Inc. (Daily Caller), Herring Networks (One America News Network / OAN / OANN), Russia Today (RT), Breitbart News Network, LLC (Breitbart), Free Speech Systems LLC (InfoWars), Sputnik News, China Central Television, and similar organizations. No exceptions will be granted to prohibited organizations. Freelance journalists working for such organizations are likewise prohibited. This rule exists out of concern for the safety and rights of attendees. Any appearance by any such organization should be reported to Convention Security immediately. 

## Rule Violations
The consequences of a rules violation are determined by the lead staff of the convention. In some cases, a rules violation merits only a warning. In others, the convention will take further steps.

A rules violation may result in the attendee having their membership at the convention revoked. In such a case, the attendee is no longer allowed in convention spaces or the convention hotel for the duration of the event. If they are staying in the convention hotel, they may also be ejected from there.

A hotel may also eject an attendee from their property, with or without consulting the convention. This may prevent the attendee from accessing convention spaces. The convention is not obligated to ensure access to the convention spaces or to refund membership costs in such cases.

A ban includes a revocation of membership, with the additional stipulation that the person is not allowed to attend the convention in the future. The list of banned attendees and the reasons for their banning may be shared with other conventions or with law enforcement, in compliance with local laws. Other in-person events or online groups/sites may opt to ban the person in question as a result. In the case of severe rules violations, the convention may post an open letter or other public notification of events (such as speaking with the press or posting on official convention social media accounts), which may include the legal names of attendees who violated this code of conduct and/or committed potentially criminal acts.

The convention reserves the right to preemptively ban potential attendees. This may be based on publicly-available criminal records, social media posts, memberships in hate groups (such as the "Furry Raiders" or similar groups), previous bad behavior, bans at other conventions, or other criteria. The convention will make a good-faith attempt to alert banned persons before the convention, via whatever channels of communication seem most likely to get a result. The ban may be announced publicly.

Bans and revocations of membership that occur before the convention's pre-registration deadline will result in a refund of any money paid to convention for membership. Bans and revocations of membership after the pre-registration (such as those that occur during the convention itself) will result in forfeiture of such funds. The convention will not cover hotel costs, travel costs, or other expenses for persons who are banned or who have their membership revoked.

If an attendee is in a convention space when banned, they will be walked out by Convention Security. If they refuse to leave or return after being escorted out, the convention may contact law enforcement and press criminal trespassing charges.

The convention may contact the legal guardians of minors who violate convention rules.
