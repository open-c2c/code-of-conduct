Thank you for serving as a staff member or volunteer in our convention's Registration department! By volunteering your time in such a critical department, you help make the convention a success! However, due to the nature of the position, we must convey some ground rules and set expectations regarding the use and access to our computers and attendee **Personally Identifiable Information** (known hereafter as PII) found on those computers.

PII is considered sensitive, private information, and it is important that attendee PII be kept confidential. This is a safety concern for many attendees, as well as a potential lawsuit for the convention. Therefore, we must ask that PII only be accessed under very specific circumstances:

- When an attendee is paying for their membership.
- When an attendee is getting a replacement badge
- When an incident requires looking up attendee info. The only - people authorized to request this are: 
  - Security Duty Officer
  - Registration Director
  - Registration Assistant Directors
  - Operations Director
  - Convention Chair
- When a member of the Lost and Found staff is trying to return an item to its owner (e.g. wallet, driver’s license, conbadge, etc.).

Things that are **not** acceptable with PII include, but are not limited to:

- Do not look up an attendee's registration to tell someone **claiming to be a “friend,” "relative," or “roommate”** whether that person is attending the convention. Again, that information is private. This could put an attendee in danger.
- Do not look up **your own friends** in the registration system so that you can determine if they are attending the convention. 
  - It bears repeating: that information is private. Please contact your friend on Twitter, Discord, Telegram, or another service instead. 
- Do not relay attendee info **over the radio**, even to an authorized staff member. Never do this. It may be overheard by others.

The registration computers and printers are managed by `[[ INSERT NAMES OF TECHNICAL STAFF HERE ]]`. The following people are permitted to diagnose and troubleshoot the computers: `[[ INSERT NAMES OF TECHNICAL STAFF HERE ]]`, or anyone else they designate on-site. To protect the integrity of our hardware, we must ask that you do not do any of the following:

- Do not attempt to troubleshoot computers, servers, or printers.
- Do not attempt to change ribbons or badges on printers, nor clean the printers. This will be done by people who are trained to do so.
- Do not place food or drink near any computers or printers. In this case, “near” means “on the same table as.”
- Do not turn on the wireless antennas on any computers, or attempt to use wifi (802.11) or Bluetooth connections.
- Do not plug anything other than a convention-provided keyboard or mouse into USB ports without checking first.
- Do not attempt to give yourself higher-level access to the registration system.
- Do not attempt to give yourself higher-level access to any convention machines. This includes command-line and database access (E.g.: MySQL or Postgresql).

We apologize if any of this document seems excessively strict, but we wish to be as explicit as possible so that there are no misunderstandings. Violations of any of the rules set forth above are punishable by a verbal or written warning, revocation of staff status, or, in extreme cases, being asked to leave the convention itself.

If in doubt that a specific action is okay, please ask! We will be more than happy to add updates or clarifications to this AUP as new things happen.
