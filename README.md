# Open Code of Conduct Project
The Open Code of Conduct is a collaborative pro bono effort by Canadian Furries Coast-to-Coast and its advising partner organizations (see Endorsements). The project's purpose is to ensure that furry conventions do not have to put forth redundant effort creating codes of conduct independently.

The project lead is [Tempe O'Kun](https://bsky.app/profile/tempowrites.bsky.social).
